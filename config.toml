  text="""Hi there! If you've just stumbled across my page, you'll find that it's pretty incomplete at the moment - broken links everywhere!
  However, this page is **under construction**, and will house information about me and hopefully a small blog, eventually.
  In the meantime, a little about me; you can check out my CV at the link above, if you'd like!
   """
[[params.introduction.paragraph]]
  text=""" I'm currently enrolled in an undergraduate Physics program at the University of Guelph, where I'm trying to learn the foundational skills of being a scientist.
  I chose physics because I was interested in all branches of science, and I felt that physics was the best place to specialize, if I had to do so. 
  I've since fallen fully for physics, and want to make physics research my career.
  I've been lucky enough to have some opportunities to be involved with some research throughout my undergrad, which have even further sparked my interest in scientific research!
