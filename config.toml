   """
[[params.introduction.paragraph]]
  text=""" I'm currently enrolled in an undergraduate Physics program at the University of Guelph, where I'm trying to learn the foundational skills of being a scientist.
  I chose physics because I was interested in all branches of science, and I felt that physics was the best place to specialize since it provides tools for problem solving in all sorts of places. 
  Now that I have developed these tools, I'd like to apply them to solving some real-world problems through grad school research; hopefully, I'll make this my career.
  I've been lucky enough to have some opportunities to be involved with some research throughout my undergrad, which have even further sparked my interest in scientific research!
